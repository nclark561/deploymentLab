    <p>Billy was a legendary hero in the Land of Ooo who first appeared in "His Hero." Billy is idolized by Finn and Jake due to his reputation as a great warrior. However, by the time the two meet the hero, Billy no longer believes that violent heroism is the solution in stopping evil. Despite this, Finn and Jake are able to convince Billy that fighting evil is a good cause, gaining the hero's admiration and friendship.</p>
